## Shortcuts

You can navigate the application with the mouse!

- **Number keys (1,2,3...)**
  
  Select or unselect one of your configured documents from the search focus
  
- **TAB**
  
  Focus or unfocus the search field
  
- **ESC** 
  
  Delete search input 
  
- **Caret (^)**
  
  Backquote on EN keyboard, selects or unselects all configured documents

### Regex

Note that the search works with regex. That means:

- If you use special characters then you need to escape them (e.g. `()[]{}*+.`)
- The regex is set to case-insensitive
- You can emulate an `OR` operator with a construct like `(term1|term2)`. Oops, just saw that the highlighting is buggy, but it works, technically.
